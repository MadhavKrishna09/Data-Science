## Project Overview

This project aims to predict restaurant success on Zomato by building a predictive model and analyzing factors that contribute to restaurant performance. The insights gained from this analysis can be used by stakeholders to make informed decisions regarding new restaurant ventures, marketing strategies, and operational improvements.

## Dataset

The project utilized a dataset of over 10,000 Zomato restaurant listings. (Provide more detail if possible):

* Source of the dataset: (e.g., Web scraping, Zomato API, publicly available dataset â€“ if available, include a link).
* Key features: (e.g., restaurant name, location, cuisine, price range, online ordering availability, table booking option, ratings, reviews).

## Methodology

The project followed these steps:

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing:** The restaurant data was collected and preprocessed using Python libraries like Pandas. This likely included cleaning the data, handling missing values, and transforming features as needed.
2. **Feature Engineering:** Relevant features were engineered to enhance the model's predictive power. (Mention any specific feature engineering techniques if used).
3. **Model Building:** A Random Forest Classifier was trained to predict restaurant success.
4. **Model Evaluation:** The model's performance was evaluated, and the accuracy was determined.
5. **Data Visualization:** Matplotlib and Power BI were used to visualize trends, analyze features, and create actionable dashboards.
6. **Strategy Development:** Data-driven strategies were proposed for new market entry based on the insights gained from the analysis.

## Key Findings

* **Predictive Model Accuracy:** The Random Forest Classifier achieved a 92% accuracy in predicting restaurant success.
* **Key Success Drivers:** The analysis identified key factors influencing restaurant success, including online ordering adoption (with a 35% adoption rate observed) and premium pricing tiers.
* **Impact of Table Booking:** Restaurants offering table booking had a 40% higher likelihood of success.
* **Data-Driven Strategies:** The project proposed data-driven strategies for new market entry, which helped reduce stakeholder decision-making time by 20% through actionable dashboards.

## Tools and Technologies

* **Python:** Used for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model building, and analysis.
* **Random Forest Classifier:** The machine learning model used for prediction.
* **Pandas:** Python library for data manipulation and analysis.
* **Matplotlib:** Python library for data visualization.
* **Power BI:** Used for creating interactive dashboards and visualizing key insights.
